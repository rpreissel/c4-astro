This guide explains how to create and modify C4 architecture diagrams in this project.

## Example PlantUML Diagram

Here is an example PlantUML diagram embedded directly in the documentation:

<PlantUML file="file1" title="Example Diagram" />

## Project Structure

The LikeC4 model files are located in `c4/`:

```
c4/
├── spec.c4      # Element and relationship type definitions
├── model.c4     # Architecture model (systems, containers, components)
└── views.c4     # View definitions (diagrams)
```

## Adding a New Element

To add a new element to the architecture, edit `c4/model.c4`:

```c4
// Add a new external system
monitoring = externalSystem 'Monitoring Service' {
  description 'Application monitoring and alerting'
  technology 'Datadog'
}

// Add a relationship
ecommerce.api -> monitoring 'Sends metrics'
```

## Creating a New View

Views are defined in `c4/views.c4`. Here's how to create a new view:

```c4
views {
  // A new focused view
  view myCustomView {
    title 'My Custom View'
    description 'Shows specific elements'

    include customer
    include ecommerce.webapp
    include ecommerce.api
  }
}
```

## Using Diagrams in Documentation

To embed a diagram in your MDX documentation:

```mdx
---
title: My Architecture Page
---

import C4View from '../../../components/C4View.astro'

## System Overview

<C4View viewId="index" />
```

### Available Views

| View ID | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `index` | System Context - high-level overview |
| `containers` | Container Diagram - internal structure |
| `components` | API Components - detailed component view |
| `orderFlow` | Order Processing Flow - static view |
| `checkoutSequence` | Checkout Process - dynamic sequence diagram |

## Creating Dynamic Views (Sequence Diagrams)

Dynamic views show step-by-step interactions and can be displayed as sequence diagrams:

```c4
views {
  dynamic view mySequence {
    title 'My Sequence Diagram'
    description 'Step-by-step process flow'

    // Define steps in order
    customer -> webapp 'initiates action'
    webapp -> api 'sends request' {
      notes '
        Additional details about this step
      '
    }
    api -> database 'stores data'
    
    // Response flows (reverse direction)
    webapp <- api 'returns result'
    customer <- webapp 'shows confirmation'

    // Define actor order for sequence diagram
    include
      customer,
      webapp,
      api,
      database
  }
}
```

## C4View Props

The `C4View` component accepts these props:

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| `viewId` | `string` | required | The ID of the view to render |
| `interactive` | `boolean` | `true` | Enable zoom, pan, and navigation controls |
| `displayVariant` | `'diagram' \| 'sequence'` | `'diagram'` | For dynamic views: display as diagram or sequence |

### Displaying Dynamic Views as Sequence Diagrams

To render a dynamic view as a sequence diagram, use the `displayVariant` prop:

```mdx
{/* Default: renders as diagram */}
<C4View viewId="checkoutSequence" />

{/* Renders as sequence diagram */}
<C4View viewId="checkoutSequence" displayVariant="sequence" />
```
